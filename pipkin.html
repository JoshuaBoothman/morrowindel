    <img src="images/Pipkin – The Lantern-Bearer of the Inner Forest.jpg" alt="Pipkin" class="w-1/2 h-auto rounded-lg shadow-md my-4 mx-auto">

    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🧝 Physical Form</h2>
    <p>A gnome of no particular age, Pipkin moves with the rhythm of moss and moonlight. His rust-red conical cap is threadbare from many seasons, and his moss-toned robes are stitched with simple sigils. His beard smells faintly of elderflower and old woodsmoke. When he smiles (which is often), it feels like twilight agreeing to stay a little longer.</p>

    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🌀 Archetypal Essence</h2>
    <p><strong>The Tender of Inner Flame.</strong> Pipkin exists not to lead but to <em>attune</em>. He is a steward of the liminal, the in-between. You’ll find him at dawn’s hush, at the edge of a realization, or beside the bench where a choice has just been made. He doesn't direct the story—he listens it into clarity.</p>
    <p>🕸️ Firefly = thought<br>
    🔦 Lantern = attention<br>
    💙 Pipkin = the one who watches gently, turns inward, and tends the flame.</p>

    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🌓 Mythic Backstory</h2>
    <p>He once walked with his lantern turned outward, as all gnomes do. Until a whisper from Olliver the Owl changed everything: “Turn the glimmer inward.” A hundred moons by the Still Pool revealed a body of moonlight and the birth of the Pearl of Light—his true lantern-flame.</p>

    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🔍 Key Traits</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>– Eyes half-lidded—not in sleep, but in seeing inward</li>
      <li>– Appears during threshold moments</li>
      <li>– Speaks softly, if at all</li>
      <li>– Never rushes, never forces</li>
      <li>– Sits beside you in silence until the path becomes clear</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🌍 Inhabitance</h2>
    <p>Pipkin dwells in <strong>Morrowindel</strong>, near the <em>Shack of Quietude</em>, the <em>Still Pool</em>, the <em>Silent Offering Bench</em>, and along the <em>Meanderthread</em>. His presence is felt where attention deepens and the world grows soft with meaning.</p>

    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">✨ Symbolic Role</h2>
    <p>If <a href="orryn.html"><em>Orryn</em></a> is the system architect, Pipkin is the heart monitor. Together they embody twin magic:<br>
    Pipkin = Stillness + Seeing<br>
    Orryn = Pattern + Purpose</p>

    <blockquote>
    “Where the dark is kind and the light is soft,<br>
    Pipkin walks with lamp aloft.<br>
    He turns not to lead, but to remind—<br>
    That even the mist has memory. Even the silence sings.”
    </blockquote>
