      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">❄️ Cold Outside, Glow Within</h2>
      <p>The morning was sharp with frostbite promises—mist clinging to the hills, the air crisp as cold apples. But inside <strong>Cobblestone Cottage</strong>, warmth curled around everything like a shawl. The fire in the hearth crackled cheerfully, its scent a blend of old wood, honey, and stories.</p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🍯 The Honeydrizzle Queen Returns</h2>
      <p>At the high seat near the table's edge sat <strong>JuJu the Pixie</strong>—small of stature, vast of spirit. Her eyes sparkled with that mischievous morning glint only reserved for second breakfasts.</p>
      <p>Before her lay a plate fit for a forest queen:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 my-4">
        <li><strong>Sunfruit rounds</strong> (a secret pancake recipe only <strong>Mama</strong> knew)</li>
        <li><strong>Cloudmilk cream</strong> (soft and tart and perfect)</li>
        <li>A generous <strong>drizzle of golden honey</strong> that glistened like fairy-thread</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pop Pop</strong> lifted her into place and bowed dramatically.</p>
      <blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 italic border-yellow-400 my-4">“The Honeydrizzle Queen has returned!”</blockquote>
      <p>JuJu giggled and took her first bite with royal reverence. <strong>Mama</strong>, the quiet keeper of the skillet, watched with a smile soft as butter melting on warm bread.</p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🐉 Buttercup the Brave, Stationed at the Gate</h2>
      <p>Just a few steps away, on the other side of the hallway gate, sat <strong>Buttercup the Brave</strong>—a baby dragon of curly gold fuzz and flopsy ears.</p>
      <p>She had not been exiled. She had been <em>stationed</em>—a noble post to prevent her from <em>leaping joyfully all over JuJu</em> mid-breakfast, which she was very good at.</p>
      <p>Buttercup's snout pressed through the bars, her green eyes fixed on every spoonful with the solemn intensity of a guard at a royal feast.</p>
      <blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 italic border-yellow-400 my-4">“After we visit Omberry, I'll give you double snuggles. Promise.”</blockquote>
      <p>Buttercup blinked once, slowly. Her sacred vow of waiting was sealed.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🧣 Off to Omberry's in Lonchester</h2>
      <p>As the sun rose higher, the morning's adventure called.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 my-4">
        <li><strong>Maximillion</strong>, JuJu's radiant mother, was packing bags for the journey</li>
        <li>Baby <strong>OonaBaboona</strong> was already bundled in her berrywrap</li>
        <li><strong>Jophes</strong>, JuJu's gentle dad, kissed her crown before heading off to help those with soft voices and strong hearts</li>
        <li>And far across the hills in <strong>Lonchester</strong>, the bustling city, <strong>Omberry</strong>—a flour-dusted grandmother full of warmth and cinnamon—was baking for their arrival</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🔥 And Still, the Cottage Held Them</h2>
      <p>JuJu's plate was nearly clean. A ribbon of honey on her chin. Buttercup waited. The fire still danced. Mama wiped JuJu's face with a warm cloth. Pop Pop poured another coffee and said nothing at all.</p>
      <p>Outside, the wind was cold.<br>But inside <strong>Cobblestone Cottage</strong>, something ancient and golden stirred—<br>A memory in the making.<br>A morning never to be exactly repeated.<br>A little myth born of honey, fire, and love.</p>
